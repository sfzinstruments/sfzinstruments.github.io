Christian Collins . The accompanying PDF file (FS Kay 5-String Banjo presets list.pdf) describes the behavior of the original GigaSampler version. While most of the information presented there still applies to the SFZ conversion, a few changes have been made when creating the SFZ version: In \"FS KayBanjo (release mw1).sfz\", a key switch has been added on notes C2 and D2 (middle C = C4): C2 (default): The banjo's note range is C3 through E6 with note G4 being the string 5 sample. String 5 is the short string that is usually played with the thumb, alternating between the other fingers for that classic banjo sound. This sample assignment causes G4 to have a different tone than the neighboring notes, which are using string 1 samples. D2 : In this keyswitch, note G4 uses the string 1 sample, similar to its neighboring notes. The string 5 G4 sample is placed both below (F2-A2) and above (F6-A6) the normal banjo note range to facilitate an alternating-hand play style with one hand on the string 5 sample and the other playing the other four strings spread from C3 through E6. The string 5 sample normally only provides the pitch G4, but I have stretched it a whole step in each direction to cover notes F through A. In \"FS KayBanjo (release mw1).sfz\", the white keys C7 through A7 feature various harmonics and muted string effects that were included in the original GigaSampler file but never mapped to any keys. All samples have been edited to reduce noise and distortion. You can still hear distortion on a few samples due to the significant clipping on the originals. Other noises are occasionally present due to the recording having been made in a noisy environment. Despite these flaws, the audio quality has been greatly improved from the original version.

This sample set is not intended to be a jack-of-all-trades Rhodes, but rather, it's how I usually set up and used my Rhodes. It was recorded with EQ, with a treble boost and low-mid scoop, emphasizing the bell tones, and with substantial bark on the higher velocity layers. There are 5 layers, sampled to peak at 3dB difference per layer at on the low notes and to maintain volume throughout each layer. Not all layers are full-keyboard width, as higher notes don't change timbre as much. The set includes 67 16-bit samples, with up to 5 velocity layers, sampling every 4th white key. The samples were recorded directly from the harp connector. Samples are encoded in lossless FLAC format to reduce disk space. jRhodes3c version This is a looped version, with stereo and stereo vibrato options. Samples are looped after a few seconds, to save memory and disk space.

In each case, it's provided with and without velocity crossfade. (Velocity crossfade blends velocity layers to make timbre transition more smoothly with velocity. However, this also causes some phase issues in low notes, so you get your choice.) The stereo effect is a mild pitch-shift doubling to create a stereo image, applied in mid-side effect so that it cancels out when summed to mono. The stereo vibrato effect is similar to the classic Suitcase Rhodes stereo vibrato, except that the vibrato applies to each note individually rather than the whole mix. This makes it sound very different from the classic effect, but nonetheless it's a very interesting effect. The width for either of these effects is controlled via the MOD wheel. MOD wheel at zero is mono; at 50% gives 100% stereo, and pushed higher you get \"extra stereo.\"","title":"jRhodes3c"},{"location":"pianos/jrhodes3d/#1977-rhodes-mark-i-stage-73-shorter-looped-samples","text":"16 Mb disk space","title":"1977 Rhodes Mark I Stage 73, shorter looped samples"},{"location":"pianos/jrhodes3d/#jrhodes3-family","text":"jRhodes3 is my sampling of my 1977 Rhodes Mark I Stage 73 electric piano, which I purchased new back in 1978.
