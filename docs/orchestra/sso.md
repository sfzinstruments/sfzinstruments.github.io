Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra is a complete orchestral instrument library.  It
includes ensemble and solo instruments for all sections of the orchestra
(strings, winds, brass, percussion), as well as other useful instruments like
piano, harpsichord, and chorus.

The original version of SSO was created by Mattias Westlund in 2011,
and quickly earned a following for its excellent quality and wide selection of
instruments.  Since 2017 it has been developed and maintained by Peter Eastman.
It has grown enormously over the years, and now features a huge range of
instruments and articulations, with sound quality that rivals many commercial
libraries.
