      "The bass sampled here <a href='http://killer.jp/bass/kb-simmony.html'>
      looks odd with the shape which is a bit like a Rick bass that's been
      flipped upside down and redrawn by a fashion designer,
      and the big mirror pickguard</a>, but it's pretty much a typical Jazz bass
      underneath all that."
