The original version was created by Mattias Westlund in 2011,
and quickly earned a following for its excellent quality and wide selection of
instruments. This repository hosts the ongoing development of the library.
Mattias is no longer directly involved (although he has given his permission for
continuing to develop it) and has not personally reviewed all of the changes.
In other words, don't email him with questions about it!

The instruments are packaged in SFZ format.
They can be used with any compatible player, such as Linux Sampler, Sforzando,
and ARIA Player.
